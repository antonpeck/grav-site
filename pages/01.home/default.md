# Time is the great healer of the mind

The progress of this website is a personal mission, done at the pace of "exactly as fast as it needs to be". Have you ever had anything like that? A small, personal project, just for yourself?

That's what this is. Although I'm anxious to rush through it and share my results with the world. That approach has only worked with limited success in the past. Here, today, I have infinitely more patience, and a smidge more wisdom. It will get there when it gets there. Hopefully sooner than later, but I'm patient.

I think this will work out just fine.

Cheers!
