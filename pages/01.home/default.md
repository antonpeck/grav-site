# Time is the great healer of the mind

The progress of this website is a personal mission, done at the pace of "exactly as fast as it needs to be". Have you ever had anything like that? A small, personal project, just for yourself?

That's what this is. Although I'm anxious to rush through it and share my results with the world. That approach has only worked with limited success in the past. Here, today, I have infinitely more patience, and a smidge more wisdom. It will get there when it gets there. Hopefully sooner than later, but I'm patient.

I think this will work out just fine.

Here's a quick to-do list, to illustrate where I am at with my progress:

1. Add a `changelog` that will help me stay orgainized and on-task.
1. Work through some visual mockups, and publish them to my account on [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/anton).
1. Continue to publish blog posts and page content as I can.
1. Add an `About` page, to share a little of myself here.
1. Add a `Contact` page, so that future visitors can reach out to me, if they like.

Cheers!
