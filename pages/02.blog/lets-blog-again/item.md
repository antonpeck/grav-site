## Ten years

That's how long it's been since I took this site, and my blog, seriously. I suspect that it's been awhile for others as well. As far as why this is the case, I'm sure that a) the rise of social media had a strong influence, b) there are an infinite number of other influences that nudge writers one direction or another, and c) this is unlikely something that many people are really that bothered with.

For others like myself, maybe this is something that feels like it's been missing for far too long. My influences were not only Social Media, but a slow loss of interest. The inability to answer the question "Why?"

Maybe now that I'm a little older, a little wiser, and a little less hard on myself, I've come to the conclusion that we don't have to over-think everything. Just work on it to satisfy an internal checkbox. Write more, more often, so that I can share various thoughts and knowledge with anyone who happens to stop by. Mostly, I imagine that it will just be for me, for a while.

### Self-reflection, and moving forward

This post is here to serve a few small, yet important goals:

1. Be a readable first post that is considerably more interesting than a paste-job of Latin. Been there. Done that. Starting a new blog with an actual blog post. Mind blown.
1. Establish a standard for future posts. Anything I write from this point on shall be no less of what I have written here.
1. Act as an aid for the design that is in progress. The strategy here is "content-first", while I work in parallel.
1. One of the few self-reflection entries that I intend to write, unless circumstances tell otherwise. Breaking the habit of being a navel-gazer is really difficult. I'm not kidding.

As a living human being (at least the last time I checked), I am a big fan of things like emotional intelligence, and mental micro-adjustments as a process, to become a better person over time. But it's easy to get lost in the weeds of analyzing problem points in order to self-improve. I was bad about doing this. It took a few major shifts in perspective for me to truly relax and stop beating myself up over small things that have little impact on the world at large.

### Update, May 15th

This website's theme and content are now set up to be synchronized to and from Github (and through that, my home computer). This little accomplishment is a good feeling, as it will aid my journey in both publishing content, as well as the eventual design of the site! Yay!

Having a near-zero audience with this blog post has some interesting effects... Such as feeling like I'm talking to myself (hello me). I do love the feeling of accomplishment I get after publishing updates, though.
